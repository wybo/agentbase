# ### Patch
  
# Class Patch instances represent a rectangle on a grid.  They hold variables
# that are in the patches the agents live on.  The set of all patches (ABM.patches)
# is the world on which the agents live and the model runs.
class ABM.Patch
  # Constructor & Class Variables:
  # * id:         unique identifier, promoted by agentset create() factory method
  # * breed:      the agentset this agent belongs to
  # * x,y:        position on the patch grid, in patch coordinates
  # * color:      the color of the patch as an RGBA array, A optional.
  # * hidden:     whether or not to draw this patch
  # * label:      text for the patch
  # * labelColor: the color of my label text
  # * labelOffset:the x,y offset of my label from my x,y location
  # * n,n4:       adjacent neighbors: n: 8 patches, n4: N,E,S,W patches.
  # * pRect:      cached rect for performance
  #
  # Patches may not need their neighbors, thus we use a default
  # of none.  n and n4 are promoted by the Patches agent set 
  # if world.neighbors is true, the default.
