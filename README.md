### AgentScript

AgentScript is a minimalist Agent Based Modeling (ABM) framework based on [NetLogo](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) agent semantics.  Its goal is to promote the Agent Oriented Programming model in a highly deployable [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)/JavaScript implementation. Please drop by our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/agentscript) to get involved. We have a gh-pages site [agentscript.org](http://agentscript.org/).

#### Documentation

Currently the documentation is hosted directly on our [GitHub Pages](http://backspaces.github.io/agentscript) or directly from [agentscript.org](http://agentscript.org/) from the docco generated html found in the doc/ directory.

[**util.coffee**](docs/1-util.html): is the base module for all of the miscellaneous functions used by the rest of the project.

[**shapes.coffee**](docs/2-shapes.html): is a simple agent shapes module containing the default shapes and a few functions for getting the named shapes and adding your own shapes.

[**agentset.coffee**](docs/3-agentset.html) AgentSet is the core Array subclass used by patches, agents, and links.

[**patches.coffee**](docs/4-patches.html) The Agentset subclass for class Patches and class Patch which it manages.

[**agents.coffee**](docs/5-agents.html) The Agentset subclass for class Agents and class Agent which it manages.

[**links.coffee**](docs/6-links.html) The Agentset subclass for class Links and class Link which it manages.

[**model.coffee**](docs/7-model.html) is the top level integration for all the agentsets and is subclassed by all user models. 

[**template.html**](docs/8-template.html) is a trivial subclass of Model showing the basic structure how you build your own models.  In addition, the models/ directory contains 10 simple models used in teaching NetLogo. You can [run the model here.](models/template.html) 

#### Add-ons

The extras/ directory contains libraries that are too specialized to be in the core AgentScript but are essential for certain applications.  They are compiled to JavaScript in the lib/ directory.

[**data.coffee**](docs/data.html) A 2D DataSet library for data best expressed as an array of numbers.  It includes the ability to treat Images as data, to parse GIS elevation .asc files, to create datasets from patch variables etc.  It includes analytic abilities like nearest neighbor and bilinear sampling, convolution with 3x3 kernels, and resampling datasets to different resolutions.

[**data.tile.js**](docs/data.tile.html) An addon to the DataSet library for creating datasets from data tiles. It includes methods for embedding a [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) map, and for binding a dataset to tiles loaded by a Leaflet layer. See the [tiledroplets model](models/tiledroplets.html) for an example.

[**fbui.coffee**](docs/fbui.html) A simple start at a User Interface abstraction, with JSON representing buttons, sliders, switches and menus.  Each item in the JSON tree modifies the state of the model, either directly by setting Model variables or indirectly by calling a method in class Model.

[**as.dat.gui.js**](docs/as.dat.gui.html) A [dat.GUI](https://code.google.com/p/dat-gui/) based UI using the JSON tree mentioned above to specify the UI. This gives AgentScript a sophisticated HTML/CSS/JavaScript as well as the distributed fbui above. See the [flock model](models/flock.html) for an example.

[**mouse.coffee**](docs/mouse.html) A trivial event based interface to the mouse, mainly for direct interaction with the model's graphic layers.  It converts raw mouse coordinates into patch coordinates.

#### Sample Models

The models/ directory contains tiny models used both as unit tests and as examples to get started with.  They usually print to the console.log, so opening the developer's JavaScript console will show model information.

[**ants.html**](models/ants.html) A model of ant foraging behavior incorporating a nest location and food pheromone diffusion. 

[**buttons.html**](models/buttons.html) Stuart Kauffman's example of randomly connecting pairs of buttons in a pile resulting in a tipping point.

[**diffusion.html**](models/diffusion.html) Agents randomly flying on a patch grid dropping a color which is diffused over the grid.

[**fire.html**](models/fire.html) A CA (cellular automata) based model of fire spreading and burn behavior.

[**flock.html**](models/flock.html) The classic "boids" model where agents each follow three simple rules resulting in realistic flocking. This example uses the as.dat.gui.js extra.

[**headlessflock.html**](models/headlessflock.html) The same classic "boids" model as above, only this time agents are rendered as DOM elements instead of being drawn to a canvas.

[**gridpath.html**](models/gridpath.html) One of Knuth's great puzzles on the probability of all Manhattan traversals diagonally traversing a grid.

[**linktravel.html**](models/linktravel.html) Agents traversing a graph of nodes and links.

[**nbody.html**](models/nbody.html) A simulation of the nonlinear gravitation of n bodies.

[**prefattach.html**](models/prefattach.html) An example of a dynamic graph where new links preferentially attach to the nodes that have the most links.  This results in a power-law distribution.

[**tspga.html**](models/tspga.html) A Traveling Sales Person solution via a Genetic Algorithm showing the rapid conversion of stochastic methods.

[**droplets.html**](models/droplets.html) A simple GIS model based on an ESRI asc elevation file where droplet agents seek low-elevation patches. This example uses the data.js extra.

[**tiledroplets.html**](models/tiledroplets.html) A model similar to the above droplets.html, but here the droplets move on top of a Leaflet map, and elevation data is loaded from a tileserver as the map is panned. This example uses the data.js, data.tile.js, and as.dat.gui.js extras.

#### Sample Models Format

Our example models use CoffeeScript directly within the browser via `text/coffeescript` [script tags](http://coffeescript.org/#scripts):

      <html>
        <head>
          <title>AgentScript Model</title>
          <script src="agentscript.js"></script>
          <script src="coffee-script.js"></script>
          <script type="text/coffeescript">
          class MyModel extends ABM.Model
                ...
          model = new MyModel "layers", 13, -16, 16, -16, 16
                ...
          </script>
        </head>
        <body>
          <div id="layers"></div>
        </body>
      </html>

You can see this by running a sample model, then using the browser's View Page Source.

Often the models will print to the "JavaScript console" while they run.

#### Building a Model

Class Model is an "abstract class" with three abscract methods:

    startup() Called from Model ctor for loading files needed by model.
    setup()   Called during startup and by Model.reset()
    step()    Called by animator to advance the model one step

CoffeeScript modelers simply subclass ABM.Model, supplying the three abstract methods.  All the sample models do this, including the docs/ template example.

JavaScript modelers can simply replace the empty ABM.Model abstract methods:

    myModel = function () {
      var u = ABM.util; // useful alias for utilities
      ABM.Model.prototype.startup = function () {...};
      ABM.Model.prototype.setup = function () {...};
      ABM.Model.prototype.step = function () {...};

      // Startup like CoffeeScript examples
      var model = new ABM.Model("layers", 13, -16, 16, -16, 16, true)
        .debug() // Debug: Put Model vars in global name space
        .start();
    }

See [sketches/jsmodel.html](sketches/jsmodel.html) for a random walker in JavaScript.  We'll also have more of our models/ converted to JavaScript in the future.

#### Build

Cake is used to build agentscript.coffee from individual source files, and to compile into lib/ as agentscript.js, agentscript.min.js, and agentscript.map.  The map file allows debugging in Chrome via CoffeeScript source.

The "extras" are libraries that augment agentscript and are individually compiled into lib/ as .js, .min.js, and .map files by Cake.  Here are the primary cake tasks:

    watch         # Watch for source file updates, invoke builds
    all           # Compile coffee, minify js, create docs
    git:diff      # git diff the core and extras .coffee files
    git:prep      # cake all; git add/status
    git:commit    # commit locally, push to github
    git:pages     # checkout gh-pages, merge master, push to gh-pages, checkout master


If you are forking/pulling agentscript, install the dev dependencies with

    npm install

and build with

    node build.js all

We're currently using [coffeescript](http://jashkenas.github.io/coffee-script/extras/coffee-script.js), [shelljs](https://github.com/arturadib/shelljs), [uglifyjs](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS), and optionally [docco](http://jashkenas.github.io/docco/).

#### Contribute

Before any commit, please make sure all the models work as expected; they are our "unit tests."  We'll be adding more, smaller tests, soon.  Generally the test models will run locally with a file:// url, but http://localhost is safer.

Similarly, make sure the docco files display correctly.  They can be built with `node build.js all` or `node build.js doc`.  Sublime/Textmate markdown viewers should work for this.  Note that all single line comments are converted into docs using Markdown.  Be careful not to mistakenly add a "code" comment to the docs!

Pull requests will be accepted without your building your own gh-pages as long as the tests run OK locally.  However, if you want to be awesome, once your pull request is accepted, merge your changes into the gh-pages branch, update the README.md, and send another pull request!

The typical workflow looks like:

* cake watch - compile coffee files when they change.
* cake all - compile & minify all code, create docs. Done before git add to insure everything is ready for git.
* cake git:diff - diff all source and related files.  Good for creating complete commit comments.
* cake git:prep - in master, invokes "cake all", git add ., git status.  Used prior to commiting, stages all files.  Remember to git rm any files that are removed so that remote correctly sync'ed.
* cake git:commit - in master, commit locally and push to github
* cake git:pages - checkout gh-pages branch, merge master, push to github, change back to master.

The git:pages task should be run with no watch task running, otherwise unintentional compiles will occur when changing to the gh-pages branch.  Similarly, be careful your editor isn't confused by the gh-pages change .. it completely changes your working directory.  The cake git:pages task will warn you to be careful, prompting for a go-ahead.
